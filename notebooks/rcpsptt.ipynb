    "The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Trasfer Times (RCPSPTT) is an extension of the RCPSP problem defined. In RCPSP, activities are executed using available resources, precedence relationships between them must be adhered to, and the total makespan is minimized. Compared to the RCPSP, RCPSPTT introduces transfer times between activities. This means that resources do not have to be directly available after the activity that uses them finishes; rather, a transfer of resources to the following activity might be required. The transfer time depends on both the activities and the resource transferred.\n",

    "Formally, the RCPSPTT problem is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal{A}=\\{0,1,\\ldots,\\hat{A}\\}$, $\\ \\hat{A}\\in\\mathbb{N}$, be a set of activities with indices $i,j\\in\\mathcal{A}$. (RCPSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P\\in\\mathbb{N}^{|\\mathcal{A}|}$ be a vector of activity processing times. (RCPSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal{E}=\\{(i,j)\\mid \\text{activity } i \\text{ precedes activity } j\\}$ be a set of precedences. (RCPSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal{R}=\\{0,1,\\ldots,\\hat{R}\\}$, $\\ \\hat{R}\\in\\mathbb{N}$, be a set of primary resources indexed by $r\\in\\mathcal{R}$. (RCPSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $C\\in\\mathbb{N}^{|\\mathcal{R}|}$ be a vector of primary resource capacities. (RCPSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{Q}\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{{\\ge 0}}^{|\\mathcal{A}|\\times|\\mathcal{R}|}$ be the activity–resource consumption matrix, with entries $\\mathbf{Q}_{i,r}$ denoting the consumption of resource $r$ by activity $i$ ($i=0 \\Rightarrow \\mathbf{Q}_{i,r}=C_r$). (RCPSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\Delta\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^{|\\mathcal{A}|\\times|\\mathcal{A}|\\times|\\mathcal{R}|}$ be a matrix of transfer delays, with entries $\\Delta_{i,j,r}$ denoting the delay required if resource $r$ is transferred between activities $i$ and $j$. (RCPSPTT)"

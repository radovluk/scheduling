If you know you have some constraints on the preemption of tasks (for instance that each individual activity has a minimal duration larger than the time unit), this can be exploited in the model to create less sub-activities.\n",

    "Segment the tasks: Represent each task as a group of smaller sub-tasks (intervals) that collectively constitute the whole task. Use a span constraint to link them – for example, span(TaskInterval, [Part1, Part2, ...]) ensures the high-level task interval spans exactly all its present sub-intervals\n",

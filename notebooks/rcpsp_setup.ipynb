    "This notebook demonstrates how to model and solve the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Sequence-Dependent Setup Times\n",
    "using Constraint Programming with IBM’s CP Optimizer via the [`docplex.cp`](https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/docplex-doc/cp/refman.html) Python API.\n",
    "This problem extends the classical RCPSP (see [`rcpsp.ipynb`](https://github.com/radovluk/CP_Cookbook/blob/main/notebooks/rcpsp.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the RCPSP with setup times, each task has a fixed duration and uses renewable resources with limited capacities, just like in the basic RCPSP. In addition, when two tasks are processed one after the other on the *same* machine, we must also account for a **setup time** between them - such as cleaning, tool changes, or reconfiguration. A feasible schedule must satisfy all precedences, never exceed resource capacities at any moment, and insert the required setup delays between consecutive tasks on each machine. The goal remains to choose start times so that the project finishes as early as possible (minimize the makespan) while respecting **both** the usual RCPSP constraints **and** these setup-time requirements."
